Project Context: Random Video Chat MVP (Omegle-style)
1. Project Goal

Build a fully functional MVP for a random video chat platform similar to Omegle, but:

Modern

Minimal

Clean UI

No gradients

No flashy visuals

Focused on performance and clarity

This is not a demo. This is a working MVP.

We will build it step by step, feature by feature, without skipping foundations.

2. Core Product Definition

A web app where:

Users authenticate

Choose interests

Get matched randomly with another user

Can video chat, audio chat, and text chat

Can skip and get a new match instantly

3. Tech Stack (Strict)
Frontend

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

UI style:

Minimal

Flat

Neutral colors (black, white, gray)

No gradients

No skeuomorphism

No heavy animations

Backend

Custom signaling server

Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express

WebSocket library: Socket.IO

Hosted on:

Render (preferred)

Railway / Fly.io acceptable alternatives

Database & Auth

Firebase

Firebase Authentication

Firestore (for minimal metadata only)

Firebase is used ONLY for:

Authentication

User identity

Basic profile data (interests, flags)

All real-time logic is handled by the custom backend.

4. Authentication Rules

Use Firebase Authentication

Auth methods:

Google Sign-In

Anonymous Sign-In (optional for MVP)

On successful login:

Generate Firebase ID Token

Send token to backend

Backend verifies token using Firebase Admin SDK

Backend never trusts the client blindly

5. Matching Logic
Interest Matching

User selects interests (tags)

Backend matchmaking:

First try matching users with at least 1 common interest

If none available after timeout, match randomly

Matching Rules

One active chat per user

No self-matching

No rematching with the same user immediately

Queue-based matchmaking system

6. Real-Time Communication
Video & Audio

Use WebRTC

Peer-to-peer media connection

Backend acts ONLY as:

Signaling server

Matchmaker

Text Chat

Real-time messaging via WebSocket

Messages are not stored (ephemeral)

7. Core Features (MVP Only)
Must Have

User authentication

Interest selection

Random matchmaking

Video chat

Audio chat

Text chat

Skip / Next button

Clean connection state handling

Explicitly NOT in MVP

No user profiles

No friend system

No chat history

No moderation AI

No recording

No payments

No ads

8. UI / UX Principles

Black & white dominant palette

One main screen at a time

Zero visual noise

Fast transitions

Clear states:

Connecting

Waiting

Connected

Disconnected

UI should feel:

Calm

Focused

Professional

Slightly brutalist

9. File Structure Expectations
Frontend (example)
/app
  /auth
  /chat
  /interests
/components
/hooks
/lib
/types

Backend (example)
/src
  /socket
  /matchmaking
  /webrtc
  /auth
  server.ts

10. Development Rules for AI

Build incrementally

Never jump ahead

Always explain:

Why a decision is made

What problem it solves

Prefer clarity over cleverness

Avoid over-engineering

Everything must run locally before deployment

Treat security seriously (token verification, socket auth)

11. Step-by-Step Build Order (Mandatory)

Project structure

Firebase setup

Authentication flow

Backend server + WebSocket setup

Auth verification on sockets

Interest selection UI

Matchmaking logic

WebRTC signaling

Video/audio connection

Text chat

Skip / reconnect logic

Basic UI polish

Deployment

No steps skipped. No shortcuts.

12. End Goal of MVP

At the end, a user should be able to:

Open the site

Log in

Choose interests

Get matched

Video + audio + text chat

Skip and instantly get another user

That’s it.
Anything beyond this is post-MVP.
